Additional heuristics:

1) Sum of Heights
Sum of heights is the sum of the heights of each column of the Tetris field.
This heuristic simulates the number of lines cleared by making a move. A state with more lines cleared will have a smaller sum of heights. This heuristic is similar to the sum of holes heuristic, but still directed at clearing lines even if the number of holes does not decrease.

2) Maximum Height Difference
Maximum height difference is the difference between the tallest column and the shortest column in the Tetris field. 
This heuristic discourages moves that increase the maximum height of the field, and encourages moves that raises the minimum height of the field. While similar to φ11 to φ19, this heuristic specifically targets flattening the field, rather than flattening adjacent columns.

3) Grouped Holes
A grouped hole is a group of holes that are connected by adjacent holes.
This heuristic encourages grouped holes as opposed to separated holes, following the idea that grouped holes are easier to fill up with tetrominos.

4) Squares Above Holes
Squares above holes is the sum of 'number of squares above the lowest hole' for each column. This discourages moves that shift holes further from the surface of the field.
